# Direct UML

## Overview
Direct UML is a dynamic tool designed to streamline the visualization of software architectures. It automatically generates UML diagrams from your project's folder structure, offering a real-time, interactive view of your system's design directly within your development environment.

## Key Features

### Diagram Generation
- **Automatic Visualization**: Generate UML diagrams automatically from your project's folder and file structure.
- **Draw.io Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Draw.io for an enhanced diagramming experience, allowing for detailed and customizable visual representations.

### Code and Diagram Synchronization
- **Bidirectional Updates**: Modify your code or your UML diagram, and see the changes reflected across both platforms in real-time. This feature ensures that your diagrams and codebase remain in sync, enhancing the accuracy of your system documentation.

### Future Enhancements

#### Generative AI Integration
- **Design Pattern Application**: Leverage generative AI to suggest and apply design patterns directly within your diagrams. This feature aims to make system architecture more intuitive and efficient for developers, guiding the design process with intelligent pattern recognition and implementation.

#### Enhanced Interactivity
- **Interactive Diagram Manipulation**: Further enhance the interactivity between the codebase and the UML diagrams. Manipulating elements within the diagram will directly update the corresponding code, and vice versa, making architectural modifications more intuitive and streamlined.

## Vision
Our vision for Direct UML is to create a tool that not only simplifies the visualization of software architecture but also actively assists in the design and development process through intelligent, AI-driven features. By enhancing the synergy between code and diagrams, Direct UML aims to become an indispensable part of the developer's toolkit, fostering a more intuitive and efficient design process.
